# Neural-Language-Model
Pytorch implementation of a simple GRU language model trained on Donald Trump's tweets. 
 
Dataset - 30649 Trump's tweets from @realDonaldTrump obtained from [here](http://trumptwitterarchive.com/)

Model - A simple GRU based language model. Improvements to be made.

Train the model - `python3 train.py`

To do : 
* Improve the word level language model
* Build character level model
* modularize the code
